## LiDAR Cone Detection
This codebase uses Bayes Theorem to detect traffic cones from 2D-Range LiDAR data points. It is a part of the obstacle detection tasks for the "Millipod" autonomous vehicle project.

## Material Recognition 
This codebase contains a content-based image retrieval system and a user interface made with the tkinter library. It allows users to select arbitrary areas of an input image and returns the most similar images from the database. This codebase is a prototype of a tool that helps 3D artists recognize materials from 2D images or UV maps.

## Remote Vital Signs Sensing
This folder contains the code example for my work as an undergraduate research assistant for the MTTS-CAN research group. My main work was to create different variations of video data using background and lighting augmentations, then evaluate a deep learning model on the new data to determine the effect of data augmentation on model performance.
